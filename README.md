## Compatibility

The list below are boards where this project ran successfully:

- Arduino UNO R3

## How To Use

The `sensor` folder has the source code which you should upload to your Arduino board.
If you would like to visualize the radar, you should open the folder `radar` and then type the following command:

```sh
python 3 main.py
```

## Screenshots

### Sensor

### Radar

The image below shows the radar running where each point represents the luminosity level provided by the Arduino board. The closer to the outer arc, the brighter the light.

## Donate

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications for free! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, reach out to me if you want to do it.

Thanks!

❤️
